Roblox Revival Cloud Server

This is a basic revival server for old Roblox clients (like 2018). You can deploy it to free cloud services like Render, Replit, or Railway.

Files:
- server.py: Main Flask app
- requirements.txt: Python packages needed
- README.txt: This file

Deployment (Replit or Render):
1. Upload these files to your service.
2. Install requirements (Flask, flask-cors)
3. Run `server.py`
4. Your app will be available at a public URL.
5. In your modified Roblox APK, replace roblox.com URLs with this server's URL.

Endpoints:
- / : Homepage
- /login : Fake login returns a ticket
- /users/<id> : Mock user profile info
- /asset/ : Fake asset data

Enjoy your revival!
